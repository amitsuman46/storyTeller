‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT: CREATE YOUR .env FILE
=====================================

Before running the app, you MUST create a .env file!

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
--------------------------

1. Create a new file in the project root folder (where package.json is)
2. Name it exactly: .env
3. Add these two lines:

VITE_SECRET_KEY=mySecretKey123
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-actual-gemini-api-key-here


GETTING YOUR GEMINI API KEY:
----------------------------

1. Visit: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated key (starts with "AIza...")
5. Paste it in the .env file


EXAMPLE .env FILE:
------------------

VITE_SECRET_KEY=myPassword2024
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyAbc123xyz...your-actual-key


IMPORTANT NOTES:
---------------

‚úÖ The .env file should be in the ROOT directory (same level as package.json)
‚úÖ No spaces around the = sign
‚úÖ No quotes needed around the values
‚úÖ Keep this file SECRET - never share it or commit it to Git
‚úÖ You can change VITE_SECRET_KEY to any password you want
‚úÖ The secret key is what you'll use to login to the app


SHARING WITH FRIENDS:
--------------------

When you deploy to Render, you'll set these environment variables there.
Then you only need to share:
- The Render URL
- Your VITE_SECRET_KEY (the password)

Your friends don't need the Gemini API key - only you do!


TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------

‚ùå "Secret key not configured" error?
   ‚Üí Make sure .env file exists and has VITE_SECRET_KEY

‚ùå "Gemini API key is not configured" error?
   ‚Üí Make sure .env file has VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY

‚ùå "Invalid API key" error?
   ‚Üí Double-check your Gemini API key is correct

‚ùå App still not working?
   ‚Üí Restart the development server (npm run dev)


VERIFICATION:
------------

To verify your .env file is set up correctly:

1. Make sure the file is named exactly ".env" (with the dot)
2. It should be in the root folder, not in src/
3. It should have both VITE_SECRET_KEY and VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY
4. Restart your dev server after creating/editing .env


After creating the .env file, run:

npm install
npm run dev


Good luck! üöÄ
